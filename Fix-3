I added the -U classification_1st_page flag to nenscript, because I
needed it for HDSIUCS (Hard Disk Subsystem Interface Unit Control
Software).  Since someone else might need this feature also, I am
releasing my changes into the public domain also.

I made trivial modifications to the options handling to provide
marginally better diagnostics.

I also renamed the package nenscript-1.13.3, because I think 1.13++ is
a poor choice of version number.

These changes were made on my own time and on my own computer, but
could easily be construed as being part of my official duties as an
AWACS software programmer/analyst.  If this is the case, then any
changes that I made are a work of the US government and are not
subject to copyright protection in the United States, and furthermore
are provided, free of charge, with no warantee.  If my changes are not
legally part of my official duties, then I hereby disclaim all rights
to the aforementioned changes and explicitly put them in the public
domain, and furthermore disclaim any warantee, express or implied.  I
am not an intellectual property lawyer, so I'm not sure which of these
situations applies.  Either way, the changes are free to you.
